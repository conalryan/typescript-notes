# Tree

### All programming eventually leads to trees
I swear, every complex project I have ever worked on ends up being a tree exercise.

### Where are trees?
- Your filesystem is a tree
- The dom is a tree
- Trees are massively important in compilers. You have probably mininumly heard the term Abstract Syntax Tree.
- and there is more...

### Terminology
- root - the most parent node. The First. Adam.
- height - The longest path from the root to the most child node
- binary tree - a tree in which has at most 2 children, at least 0 children. Most commonly used. Often it will use left; and right; instead of an array of two children.
- general tree - a tree with 0 or more children
- binary search tree - a tree in which has a specific ordering to the nodes and at most 2 children
- leaves - a node without children
- balanced - A tree is _perfectly_ balanced when any node's left and right children have the same height.  The more out of balanced your tree, the harder some algorithms will be.
- branching factor - the amount of children a tree has.
