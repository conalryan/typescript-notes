/**
 * Reverse a linked list by Iterative Method:
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/
 * Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list.
 * We need to reverse the list by changing the links between nodes.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: Head of following linked list
 * 1->2->3->4->NULL
 * Output: Linked list should be changed to,
 * 4->3->2->1->NULL
 *
 * Input: Head of following linked list
 * 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
 * Output: Linked list should be changed to,
 * 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
 *
 * Input: NULL
 * Output: NULL
 *
 * Input: 1->NULL
 * Output: 1->NULL
 *
 * Solution:
 * Reverse a linked list by Iterative Method:
 * The idea is to use three pointers curr, prev, and next to keep track of nodes to update reverse links.
 *
 * Follow the steps below to solve the problem:
 * - Initialize three pointers prev as NULL, curr as head, and next as NULL.
 * - Iterate through the linked list. In a loop, do the following:
 *    1. store the next node
 *    2. swap the curr.next to prev
 *    3. update prev to curr
 *    4. update curr to next
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N), Traversing over the linked list of size N.
 * Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 *
 * reverse a linked list
 * 1. iterative method
 *
 * 1.1. cache next
 * next = curr.next;
 *
 * 1.2. swap current node next to prev
 * curr.next = prev;
 *
 * 1.3. move prev
 * prev = curr;
 *
 * 1.4. move curr
 * curr = next;

/**
 * Reverse a linked list using Recursion:
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/
 * The idea is to reach the last node of the linked list using recursion then start reversing the linked list.
 *
 * Solution
 * Follow the steps below to solve the problem:
 * - Divide the list in two parts â€“ first node and rest of the linked list.
 * - Call reverse for the rest of the linked list.
 * - Link the rest linked list to first.
 * - Fix head pointer to NULL
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N), Visiting over every node one time
 * Auxiliary Space: O(N), Function call stack space
 *
 * 1. Divide the list into two parts
 *    1. First
 *    2. Rest
 * 2. Reverse the Rest
 *    1. Rest.prev = First
 * 3. Link Rest to First
 *    1. First.next.next = First
 *    2. First.next = null
 * 4. Change Head
 *    1. head = rest
