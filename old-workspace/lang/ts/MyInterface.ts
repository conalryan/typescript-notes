/**
 * Interface
 *
 * Describes objects that have a 'aString' and 'anotherString' and perhaps an 'optionalField' field. 
 * In TypeScript, two types are compatible if their internal structure is compatible. This allows us to 
 * implement an interface just by having the 'shape' the interface requires, without an explicit implements clause.
