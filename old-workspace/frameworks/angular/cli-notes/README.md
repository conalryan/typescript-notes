## Multi Application Build Issue
- Managing multiple applications within a single directory, means we cannot share and reuse common code across the multiple applications easily. We cannot configure the build process for each application without the aid of npm scripts.

## [Angular Workspace](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/angular-workspace)
- Directory which is generated via Angular CLI and able to contain multiple projects or libraries that derive the configuration out of a single file (Angular CLI v6+).

The [@nrwl/schematics](https://blog.nrwl.io/introduction-to-nrwl-bazel-schematics-c391911a5e9f) set is an excellent example of another Schematics implementation for the sake of development and maintenance of Angular applications - with an emphasis on enterprises.
